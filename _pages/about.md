Currently, I'm a working as a AI Reserch Scientist at Fusemachines and as a AI Consultant at Take Two Interactive Software, Inc in the field of time-series analysis for sales and demand forecasting. Before, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at NYU Tandon School of Engineering in the field fairness aware AI for healthcare. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tennessee Tech University, and Master’s in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Netherlands.

Past Research Projects
------
As part of my postdoctoral research involved the study of the problem of learning fair models under mismatch in train-test distributions when either limited or no data is available from the test distribution. We consider the setup of causal domain adaptation where possible shifts are expressed using causal graphs with the goal of learning models with stable performance under the specified shifts. We find that methods to address distribution shift, while controlling for decay in accuracy, can result in fairness violations. As a counter measure, we show that it is possible to obtain accurate and fair predictors for widely studied fairness definitions and under a large class of shifts particularly prevalent in healthcare tasks.

As part of my Ph.D. research involved the design and development of algorithms to more efficiently and effectively analyze of sequences associated with specific events. For example, the identification of patterns of events that precede or follow a diagnosis of sepsis could be important for understanding and improving healthcare care decisions in a hospital, and while the primary motivation for my research was to improve our ability to analyze clinical data, the research described in the dissertation is applicable in many other domains.
