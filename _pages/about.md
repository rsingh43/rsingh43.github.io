Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Rumi Chunara](https://rumichunara.github.io/). Before, I worked as a Research Assistant at Tennessee Tech University, under the supervision of [Prof. Doug Talbert](https://users.csc.tntech.edu/~dtalbert/). I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tennessee Tech University, Master’s in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Netherlands, and a B.E. in Software Engineering from Nepal College of Information Technology.

Current Research Projects
------
Currently, I am working in understanding how temporal and sequential aspects are useful when analyzing healthcare data, through the use of data mining, machine learning, deep learning and causal inference techniques.

Past Research Projects
------
As part of my Ph.D. research involved the design and development of algorithms to more efficiently and effectively analyze of sequences associated with specific events. For example, the identification of patterns of events that precede or follow a diagnosis of sepsis could be important for understanding and improving healthcare care decisions in a hospital, and while the primary motivation for my research was to improve our ability to analyze clinical data, the research described in the dissertation is applicable in many other domains.
